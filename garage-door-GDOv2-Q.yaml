# INTRODUCTION
#
# This ESPHome based firmware configuration is designed for the Konnected Garage Door Opener GDOv2-S which is built on the ESP32-S3-MINI.
# The Garage Door Opener retrofits an older style traditional garage door opener with a dry-contact trigger and has the
# following features which are included as packages below:
#
# 1. Wired contact sensor for detecting open/closed state of garage door
# 2. Optical range sensor for detecting open/closed state of garage door
# 3. Emulates a garage door opener button wired to a dry contact relay to open/close the garage door.
# 4. Adds a Garage Door "Cover" entity that is exposed to Home Assistant. The cover entity incorporates the state of the
#    garage door and controls to open/close/stop it.
# 5. Flashes an onboard LED and beeps an onboard piezo sounder as a warning before automatically closing.
