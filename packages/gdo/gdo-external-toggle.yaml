# Adds an external toggle switch via Input (1) or (2) on the GDO blaQ
# which enables the connection of a basic button, switch or dry-contact
# relay to toggle the garage door, just like in the old days!
#
# This can be useful to integrate a newer Security+ garage opener with an external
# system that has a relay output
#
# Defaults to a 'Normally Open' relay type, with a momentary contact triggering
# the door. Change `inverted` to "false" for 'Normally Closed'

defaults:
  inverted: "true"
